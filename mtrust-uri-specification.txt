1. Introduction
---------------
The `mtrust` URI scheme defines a mechanism to identify and reference resources, tasks, or agents in the context of ModelTrust Protocol (MTP), a protocol designed for trusted interactions and control signaling among artificial intelligence systems and their supervisory controls.

This specification details the syntax, semantics, and use cases for the `mtrust` URI scheme.

2. Scheme Name
--------------
mtrust

3. Scheme Semantics
-------------------
The `mtrust` scheme identifies resources and tasks within ModelTrust Protocol environments, enabling trusted command exchanges and resource addressing between AI Model Proxy Controllers and participating agents.

Example:
  mtrust://controller.domain.example/task/execute?model_id=abc123

In this example:
- `controller.domain.example` identifies the authority (usually the domain of the controller).
- `/task/execute` specifies the resource (task/action).
- `model_id=abc123` is an example query parameter identifying a specific model.

4. URI Syntax
-------------
General form:
  mtrust://<authority>/<resource-path>?<query-parameters>

Components:
- **authority**: Domain name or IP identifying the trusted controller or resource owner.
- **resource-path**: Defines the resource or action (must follow URL encoding per RFC3986).
- **query-parameters**: Optional parameters in the standard URI query format.

5. Encoding Considerations
--------------------------
- The scheme uses UTF-8 encoding for the path and query segments.
- Reserved characters must be percent-encoded per RFC3986.

6. Interoperability Considerations
---------------------------------
The scheme is designed for closed and federated systems implementing MTP. Cross-system interoperability depends on consistent adherence to the MTP specification.

7. Applications and Protocols Using This Scheme
-----------------------------------------------
- ModelTrust Protocol (MTP) Clients and Servers.
- AI Model Proxy Control (MPC) Systems for secure signaling, control, and task orchestration.

8. Security Considerations
--------------------------
- The `mtrust` scheme is intended for secure environments; usage over unencrypted channels is prohibited.
- Implementations must ensure:
  - Strong transport security (e.g., TLS)
  - Authentication of participants
  - Authorization policies for each action/resource
  - Logging and audit mechanisms for critical actions

Misuse of this scheme may lead to unauthorized access to AI control systems if security measures are not enforced.

9. Examples
-----------
Example 1:
  mtrust://controller.ai.example.com/task/monitor?model_id=xyz789

Example 2:
  mtrust://secure-node.local/resource/heartbeat

Example 3 (JSON API Payload):
{
  "uri": "mtrust://controller.domain.example/task/execute?model_id=xyz123",
  "auth_token": "abcdef123456",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-08T12:34:56Z"
}

14. Relationship to HTTP and Other URI Schemes
----------------------------------------------
The `mtrust` URI scheme is intentionally distinct from HTTP(S). It is designed specifically for use within AI Model Proxy Control systems and specialized protocols such as the ModelTrust Protocol (MTP).

Unlike HTTP(S), which is intended for resource retrieval via web servers, the `mtrust` scheme provides identifiers for tasks, agents, and commands within trusted control networks. These identifiers are not intended for resolving resources via the web or for use in browsers.

Key differences:
- `mtrust` is a control and signaling identifier, not a content retrieval mechanism.
- It is protocol-specific and meaningful only within MTP-compliant systems.
- It can operate independently of HTTP transport, potentially over protocols such as MQTT, gRPC, or other message-based systems.
- Security models rely on internal controls beyond the scope of HTTPS alone.

As such, `mtrust` URIs are not interchangeable with HTTP(S) URIs and are not intended for use in general-purpose internet applications.
